## Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

## Introduction

### Purpose
The Instagram Clone project aims to create a social media platform that allows users to share photos, videos, stories, and interact with others through likes, comments, and direct messaging. The goal is to replicate key features of Instagram and provide an intuitive user experience for connecting and sharing content globally.

### Scope
This project includes the following features:

- Photo and video posting with optional filters
- Liking, commenting, and sharing posts
- Following/unfollowing users
- Direct messaging between users
- Story creation and sharing
- User notifications for interactions

The project will be developed as a web application, optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.

## Overall Description

- **Notifications**: Alerts users of interactions such as likes, comments, follows, and messages.

### User Characteristics
Target users are individuals familiar with social media platforms, ranging from casual users to influencers. Users expect a visually appealing, easy-to-navigate interface.

### Constraints
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Must comply with privacy regulations like GDPR and CCPA.
- **Performance**: Handle a large number of users and media uploads efficiently.
